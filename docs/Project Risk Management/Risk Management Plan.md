<h2>Risk Management Plan</h2>
<h4>Methodology:</h4>
   <p> Risk Management is a process where we identify risk and try to manage those areas. By using any of the methodology we can avoid the risk that may cause negative impact on the success of the project by how we will identify and access risk as well as monitoring those risks</p>
<h4>Roles and responsibilities:</h4>
   <p> We will create a responsibility chart or matrix  where we list roles and responsibilities of Every individual ranging from risk owner, project manager, project team, stakeholders so that everyone is aware their risk management activities.</p>

<h4>Risk categories:</h4> 
   <p> There are a wide range of risks involved while dealing with a project for example Market risk, cost Risk and financial risk. Every organization has their own version on risk breakdown structure(RBS).</h4>
 <h4>Risk probabilities and impact:</h4> 
   <p> Risk can be measured by various factors few may include slip of budget, not meeting needs of customer which may be huge loss to the company.</p>
 <h4>Revised stakeholders’ tolerance:</h4> 
    <p> Stakeholders are informed about the risk during every stage of the project. They tolerate only certain extent of incomplete deliverables. </p>
 <h4>Tracking:</h4>
    <p>We maintain issue log in every project we keep track of all the issues that have occurred from project start to its end. We track them until they are solved or dealt with. Weekly reviews also help in keeping them in check so we can prevent them. From reoccurring.</p>
