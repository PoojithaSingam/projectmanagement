### Quality Metrics

Quality metrics are a key component of an effective quality management plan and are the measurements used in ensuring customers receive acceptable products or deliverables.
Following are the metrics used to measure quality:
1. Passed Test Case Percentage = (No.of Passed Tests/Total no.of tests executed) * 100 
2. Failed Test Case Percentage = (No.of Failed Tests/Total no.of tests executed) * 100
3. Bug Find rate = Total number of defects/Total number of test hours
4. Requirements Coverage = (Number of requirements covered/Total number of requirements)*100
5. Executed Tests or Test Execution Coverage Percentage=(Number of tests run/Total number of tests to be run)*100
6. Accepted Defects Percentage = (Defects Accepted as valid by team/Total defects reported)*100
7. Number of bugs per test = Total number of defects/Total number of tests
8. Number of tests run per time period = Number of tests run/Total time
9. Test design efficiency = Number of tests designed/Total time
10. Fixed Defects Percentage = (Defects Fixed/Total Defects Reported) * 100


| S.No | Defect Level | Defect Name | Measurements|
|------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | High-Level Defects | Bugs, Planning errors | Project Manager should have a better than average data of the partners and their abilities|
| 2 | Mid-level Defects | Integration issues | when modules are united together and attempted on a whole a couple issues may develop so the testing gathering should have enough learning of the extensive number of modules|                                          
| 3 | Low-level Defects | Hard-disk specifications | Screen resolution of the PCs won't not be awesome which may not be a tremendous issue but instead work should be conceivable better if it is as per the particulars|
